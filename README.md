# Arduino_Uno_PCB
I designed the PCB described in a course I took on the Udemy platform in August 2022.
With this course, I designed Arduino Uno by using its reference schematic. I learned how to re-draw the schematic, modify it, improve it and how to do PCB layout.  
In this project, I drew schematic and learned tips for component selection and important circuits. I created components, draw schematic symbols and footprints. I placed components into my PCB and routed PCB. I create 3D model of my board. I created board variants with different components (fitted / not fitted). I created Bill of Material (BOM) list, generated Gerbers, Pick and Place, Drill file and other files needed for manufacturing
Also, by the end of this course, I created all the necessary documents needed to manufacture the board.
